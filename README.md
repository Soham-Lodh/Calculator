# 🧮 Calculator
A CLI-based C program that serves as a multi-purpose calculator, supporting:

### • 📊 Arithmetic Operations

### • 🔢 Matrix Operations (partial support)

### • 🧭 Vector Operations

### • ⚛️ Complex Number Operations

## 🚀 Features
### 1. 🔢 Arithmetic Calculator (a)
Executes basic arithmetic between two numbers:

• ➕ Addition (+)

• ➖ Subtraction (-)

• ✖️ Multiplication (*)

• ➗ Division (/)

• 🧮 Modulus (%)

• 🔺 Power (^)

### 2. 🧮 Matrix Calculator (m)
Supports operations between 2D matrices:

• ➕ Addition (+) – same dimensions

• ➖ Subtraction (-) – same dimensions

• ✖️ Multiplication (*) – compatible dimensions

• 🔢 Sum of All Elements (^) – single matrix

• 🔷 Sum of Diagonal Elements (#) – trace

• 💡 Note:
Inverse, transpose, determinant, and scalar multiplication are not available.
Matrix dimension compatibility is not auto-checked – ensure inputs are valid.

### 3. 🧭 Vector Calculator (v)
Operates on 3D vectors:

• ➕ Addition (+)

• ➖ Subtraction (-)

• 🔘 Dot Product (.)

• 🔄 Cross Product (*)

### 4. ⚛️ Complex Number Calculator (i)
Handles operations between two complex numbers:

• ➕ Addition

• ➖ Subtraction

• ✖️ Multiplication

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

gcc main.c -o calc
./calc


You’ll be prompted to select a mode:


Import Calculator
[a for arithmetic calculator]
[m for matrix calculator]
[v for vector calculator]
[i for complex calculator]
:- a
Enter Operation to perform [+ for addition]
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Result: 8
## 📌 Notes
Matrices are dynamically allocated using malloc.

All inputs are interactive via the terminal.

Matrix dimensions must be manually validated by the user.
